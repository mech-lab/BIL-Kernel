    External constants (builtins, imports) that appear in the body/proof.

??? "`local_syntactic_dependencies` · list[str] · Local constants explicitly written in source"
    Local constants that appear literally in source (not from notation/macro expansion).

??? "`external_syntactic_dependencies` · list[str] · External constants explicitly written in source"

This is a known limitation that we don't expect to address, since the alternatives below cover adversarial use cases.

??? "Basic rename with reference updates"
    Renaming `original` → `renamed` also updates all references:

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    theorem original : 1 + 1 = 2 := by simp
    example : 2 = 1 + 1 := original.symm
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    theorem renamed : 1 + 1 = 2 := by simp
    example : 2 = 1 + 1 := renamed.symm
    ```

??? "Namespaced declarations"
    Use fully qualified names (`ns.original`) to rename declarations inside namespaces:

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    namespace ns
    theorem original : 1 + 1 = 2 := by simp
    example : 2 = 1 + 1 := original.symm
    end ns

    example : 2 = 1 + 1 := ns.original.symm

    **After** (with `{"ns.original": "ns.renamed"}`):
    ```lean

    theorem renamed : 1 + 1 = 2 := by simp
    example : 2 = 1 + 1 := renamed.symm
    end ns

    example : 2 = 1 + 1 := ns.renamed.symm

This merge function is intended to be a consolidation of multiple Lean files that performs best-effort deduplication and conflict resolution. As a demonstration, we'll merge the following two files, with descriptions of features along the way.

### File 1
```
import Mathlib

open Lean

theorem D : (1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2) ∧ True := rfl
theorem A : 2 = 2 := rfl

variable (x : Nat)
theorem E : x = 5 := trivial

theorem B : 1 = 1 := rfl
theorem C2 : 1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2 := ⟨B, A⟩

set_option maxHeartbeats 0
```

### File 2
```
import Mathlib

open Lean.Elab
set_option maxHeartbeats 200000

theorem A : 4 = 4 := rfl
theorem B : 1 = 1 := rfl
theorem C1 : 1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2 := ⟨B, A⟩
theorem D : (1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2) ∧ True := ⟨C1, trivial⟩

variable (x : Nat)
theorem E : x = 5 := sorry
```

### Non-declaration commands are extracted first

Any non-declaration commands (variables, open scopes, options, notations, etc.) will be extracted _first_ from all files. These commands will be placed under a comment label like `----------------------`

Note that this may break files, since many of these commands have global side effects that change how a proof is run, so it is a good idea to normalize your code first, whether manually or by calling [normalize](normalize.md).

This gives us:
```
----------------------
open Lean
variable (x : Nat)
set_option maxHeartbeats 0

----------------------
open Lean.Elab
set_option maxHeartbeats 200000
variable (x : Nat)
```

Pay attention to how we have conflicting commands here: at first, we set `maxHeartbeats` to 0, and then immediately reset it to 200000. Until we figure out a better way to handle this scenario, it is good to keep in mind.

### Declarations are merged respecting dependencies

All remaining commands will be declarations, and will be merged in topological order.

### Conflict resolution via renaming

Notice that both files have a theorem `A`, which assert different things. The merge function will automatically rename one of them to a globally unique identifier. Note that our renaming function is fairly robust as seen in the [rename](rename.md) endpoint.
```
theorem A : 2 = 2 := rfl

theorem A_1 : 4 = 4 := rfl
```

### Deduplication of identical theorems

Theorem `B` exists in both files here, so we merge them into a single theorem.

```
theorem B : 1 = 1 := rfl
```

Note that we also merge non-theorems (e.g., definitions and structures), but these must have the same *value* in addition to having the same type, because they *are* implementation-specific.

### Deduplication merges theorems with different names

Theorem `C` exists in both files, but with different names (`C1` vs. `C2`). Our merge function will automatically detect this equivalence and generate a unique name to use in the merged file.
```
theorem C2_1 : 1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2 := ⟨B, A⟩
```

### Preference for error-free and sorry-free declarations

Theorem `D` exists in both files, but in the first file, the proof `rfl` completely fails, so we'll prefer the implementation in the second file.

```
theorem D : (1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2) ∧ True := ⟨C2_1, trivial⟩
```

Notice something interesting here: in the first file, `D` was declared *before* `A, B, C` existed, so there couldn't possibly be a proof of `D` that uses `A, B, C`. However, our dependency tracking figures out that since we should use the implementation in the second file, we need the dependencies from that file, where `A, B, C` *are* defined.

### Unsuccessful attempts are preserved as comments

If no successful proofs exist, we select one arbitrarily, but keep the others as reference. We retain the remaining unsuccessful proofs as comments following the chosen proof, with the signposting `unsuccessful attempt`.

```
theorem E : x = 5 := trivial

/-
-- unsuccessful attempt
theorem E : x = 5 := sorry
-/
```

### Final File

??? "`remove_unused_tactics`"
    Removes tactics that don't contribute to the proof.

    In `theorem foo : 1 = 1 := by rfl <;> rfl`, the second `rfl` is useless and should be removed.

??? "`remove_unused_haves`"
    Removes unused `have` statements.

    ```lean
    theorem foo (a b : Nat) :
        a ≤ a + b := by
      have h : a + 0 ≤ a + b := by
        apply Nat.add_le_add_left ;
        exact Nat.zero_le _
      simp
    ```

    In the above theorem, `h` is useless and should be removed.

??? "`rename_unused_vars`"
    Cleans up unused variable names.

    In `theorem triv (arg : ℕ) : True := trivial`, the variable `arg` is useless. We do *not* remove it, because that would change the signature of the theorem, but we can clean things up a bit by replacing it with an underscore, as in: `theorem triv (_ : ℕ) : True := trivial`.

<!-- Not functional
#### `simplify_have_exact`
```
theorem h₁ : (5 : ℝ) ≤ Real.sqrt 26 := by
  have h : 5 ≤ Real.sqrt 26 := by apply Real.le_sqrt_of_sq_le ; norm_num
  exact h
```
In `h₁`, the `have` statement, followed by `exact` is redundant. The goal can just be proved directly:
```
theorem h₁ : (5 : ℝ) ≤ Real.sqrt 26 := by
  apply Real.le_sqrt_of_sq_le ; norm_num
```
However, this causes problems with indentation and formatting that cannot be easily fixed, so this has been disabled for now.


#### `remove_unnecessary_seq_focus`
```
theorem h₁ : (5 : ℝ) ≤ Real.sqrt 26 := by
  apply Real.le_sqrt_of_sq_le <;>
  norm_num
```
In `h₁`, the `<;>` sequence is bad style, and should be removed or replaced with `;`.
However, in the following example, even though the linter generates the same warning, it is in fact unsound to replace `<;>` with `;`.
```
theorem ref : 1 = 1 ∨ False := by
  (try left <;>
    try rfl)
```
-->


<!--
### Unsupported Features

#### `remove_unnecessary_rw_simp_arg`
In `theorem triv : 1 = 1 := by simp [Nat.add_assoc]`, the `Nat.add_assoc` argument is unnecessary and can be removed.

However, the linter is not always correct, which can sometimes result in the simplification being unsound.

#### `replace_unnecessary_simpa`
It's generally seen as bad style to use `simpa` when `simp` would suffice. This generates the linter warning "try 'simp' instead of 'simpa'". However, this doesn't always work, and also I don't really see the benefit in this simplification.

#### `remove_redundant_have`
```
theorem duh (h : 1 + 4 = 5) : 1 = 1 := by
  have h' : 1 + 4 = 5 := h
  have h'' : 1 + 4 = 5 ∨ False := by left; exact h'
  rfl
```
In this theorem, `h'` is obvious -- it's the exact same as `h`, so we should remove it. However, this has not been implemented because it also requires renaming any occurrences of `h'`. This gets a little messy because we are now dealing with local variables, which are not unique (unlike global constants). Punting for now.

??? "`remove_unknown_options`"
    Strips `set_option` references with an option name Lean doesn't recognize. Bare `set_option` commands are dropped entirely; `set_option ... in <inner>` gets unwrapped to just `<inner>` so the inner declaration / tactic / term is preserved.

    **Bare command — dropped:**
    ```lean
    import Mathlib

    set_option fake_option true

    theorem foo : 1 = 1 := by rfl
    ```
    becomes
    ```lean
    import Mathlib

    theorem foo : 1 = 1 := by rfl
    ```

    **`set_option ... in <decl>` — unwrapped:**
    ```lean
    import Mathlib

    set_option fake_option true in
    theorem foo : 1 = 1 := by rfl
    ```
    becomes
    ```lean
    import Mathlib

    theorem foo : 1 = 1 := by rfl
    ```

??? "`enable_autoImplicit`"
    When a command fails because it relies on auto-implicit binders but `autoImplicit` is disabled in the current scope, this repair prepends `set_option autoImplicit true in` to the command so it elaborates. Note that `autoImplicit` is already on by default, so this only affects code that explicitly turns it off.

??? "`relax_defeq_transparency`"
    Lean 4.29's `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency` (default `true`) keeps `isDefEq` from unfolding reducible/instance definitions when unifying implicit arguments, breaking proofs that relied on it. Mathlib turns it off per-theorem. Similarly, this repair prepends `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in` when the fix gets the proof further (all errors resolved, or the first error appears later in the source). On environments without the option, the repair is a no-op.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    import Mathlib

    open Finset in
    theorem pnat_card_Icc (a b : ℕ+) : #(Icc a b) = b + 1 - a := by
      rw [← Nat.card_Icc, ← PNat.map_subtype_embedding_Icc, card_map]
    ```

    **After (Lean ≥ 4.29):**
    ```lean
    import Mathlib

    set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
    open Finset in
    theorem pnat_card_Icc (a b : ℕ+) : #(Icc a b) = b + 1 - a := by
      rw [← Nat.card_Icc, ← PNat.map_subtype_embedding_Icc, card_map]
    ```

??? "`remove_extraneous_tactics`"
    When a proof is already complete but has extra tactics afterward, this repair removes the extraneous tactics.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    theorem extra_tactics : 1 = 1 := by
      rfl
      simp  -- This tactic is never reached
      omega
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    theorem extra_tactics : 1 = 1 := by
      rfl
    ```

??? "`apply_terminal_tactics`"
    Tries terminal tactics in place of sorries.

    In `theorem foo : 1 = 1 := by sorry`, the proof is incomplete. This repair attempts to apply terminal tactics to complete the proof. The tactics to try can be customized via the `terminal_tactics` parameter (default: `["grind"]`).

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    theorem simple_eq : 1 + 1 = 2 := by
      sorry
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    theorem simple_eq : 1 + 1 = 2 := by
      grind
    ```

??? "`replace_unsafe_tactics`"
    Replaces unsafe tactics with safer alternatives.

    Some tactics like `native_decide` use native code execution which can be unsafe. This repair replaces them with safer alternatives.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    theorem check_prime : Nat.Prime 7 := by
      native_decide
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    theorem check_prime : Nat.Prime 7 := by

There are a lot of configurable options for `have2lemma`. Let's go through them and discuss why they exist.

### Options

There are three main options to discuss:

- `include_have_body`: Whether to include have bodies in extracted lemmas. If false, lemmas will use `sorry` instead. Defaults to false.
- `include_whole_context`: Whether to include the whole context (skip cleanup) when extracting have statements. Defaults to true.
- `reconstruct_callsite`: Whether to reconstruct the callsite (replace have statement with lemma call). Defaults to false.

#### Default behavior

Let's look at the simple following example.
```
theorem example_theorem (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ r → p ∨ q := by
  intro hpr
  have h1 : p := by simp_all
  have h2 : r := by simp_all
  left
  assumption
```
The default behavior sets `include_have_body=false`, `include_whole_context=true`, and `reconstruct_callsite=false`, giving us
```
lemma example_theorem.h1 (p q r : Prop) (hpr : p ∧ r) : p := sorry

lemma example_theorem.h2 (p q r : Prop) (hpr : p ∧ r) (h1 : p) : r := sorry

theorem example_theorem (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ r → p ∨ q := by
  intro hpr
  have h1 : p := by simp_all
  have h2 : r := by simp_all
  left
  assumption
```
Here,

- both generated lemmas are sorried out -- this is the result of `include_have_body=false`.
- in both lemmas, the entire local context is provided, which is the result of `include_whole_context=true`. This might include redundant variables -- in this case, `q` isn't relevant to the goal.
- the main theorem is left unchanged -- this is the result of `reconstruct_callsite=false`.

#### `include_have_body`

Let's see what happens if we set this value to true:
```
lemma example_theorem.h1 (p q r : Prop) (hpr : p ∧ r) : p := by simp_all

lemma example_theorem.h2 (p q r : Prop) (hpr : p ∧ r) (h1 : p) : r := by simp_all
```
The output now includes the proof body!

**Why bother making this configurable?**

This option is NOT guaranteed to be robust, and might introduce errors into the file. In this example:
```
theorem complex_types : ∀ (n : Nat), n + 0 = n := by
  intro n
  have base : 0 + 0 = 0 := by rfl
  have step : ∀ m, m + 0 = m → (m + 1) + 0 = m + 1 := by
    intro m ih
    rfl
  sorry
```
the second generated lemma is
```
lemma complex_types.step : ∀ (n : ℕ), 0 + 0 = 0 → ∀ (m : ℕ), m + 0 = m → m + 1 + 0 = m + 1 := by
    intro m ih
    rfl
```
**This does not compile!!!** Notice that Lean has decided to revert `n` in the type. This means the proof will fail, because there is a missing `intro n ...`.

#### `include_whole_context`

Now let's set this option to false. In our original example, this gives us:
```
lemma example_theorem.h1 (p r : Prop) (hpr : p ∧ r) : p := sorry
lemma example_theorem.h2 (p r : Prop) (hpr : p ∧ r) (h1 : p) : r := sorry
```

Notice that the tool has now removed the `q` variable from both lemmas, as it is irrelevant to the goal and hypotheses.

**Why make this configurable?**

In general, Lean's dependency analysis is purely based on heuristics. See the source:

> A variable is *relevant* if (1) it occurs in the target type, (2) there is a relevant variable that depends on it, or (3) the type of the variable is a proposition that depends on a relevant variable.

Therefore, it's possible that a hypothesis in the context is useful even though Lean judges it to be irrelevant. In rare cases, it can break the proof when used in conjunction with `include_have_body=true`. For example:
```
theorem foo : Odd 5 ∨ Even 5 := by
  have odd : Odd 5 := by exists 2
  have sol : Odd 5 ∨ Even 5 := by
    left
    assumption
  exact sol
```
When running with `include_have_body=true` and `include_whole_context=false`, the tool will output the lemmas
```
lemma foo.odd : Odd 5 := by exists 2

lemma foo.sol : Odd 5 ∨ Even 5 := by
    left
    assumption
```
Notably, in the second lemma, Lean judged the hypothesis `odd` as irrelevant -- no good! The proof body now breaks on `assumption`.

#### `reconstruct_callsite`

Our final option is the most intricate. Let's try enabling this option:
```
...

theorem example_theorem (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ r → p ∨ q := by
  intro hpr
  have h1 : p := example_theorem.h1 p q r hpr
  have h2 : r := example_theorem.h2 p q r hpr h1
  left
  assumption
```
Here, in the main theorem, we removed the body of the have statement, replacing it with an application of the lemmas we just generated!

**Why make this configurable?**

Let's make a very small change to our original proof. Instead of running `intro hpr`, we'll have Lean generate the name for us, and just run `intros`.
```
theorem example_theorem (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ r → p ∨ q := by
  intros
  have h1 : p := by simp_all
  ...
```
Now we'll run `have2lemma` again.
```
lemma example_theorem.h1 (p q r : Prop) (a : p ∧ r) : p := sorry

lemma example_theorem.h2 (p q r : Prop) (a : p ∧ r) (h1 : p) : r := sorry

theorem example_theorem (p q r : Prop) : p ∧ r → p ∨ q := by
  intros
  have h1 : p := sorry /- try using example_theorem.h1 here -/
  have h2 : r := sorry /- try using example_theorem.h2 here -/
  left
  assumption
```
Uh oh. What happened? Notice that when we run `intros`, we introduce a new hypothesis with type `p ∧ r` -- but we haven't given it a name! This means we can't ever refer to it explicitly (i.e., it is *inaccessible*). (This is a Lean quirk which can be disabled, but hygienic names are generally a good thing.) `have2lemma` automatically generated the name `a` in the lemmas, but we can't assign anything to it -- so our tool complains that we've encountered an inaccessible variable, and gives up.

### Verbosity

The `verbosity` parameter controls how explicit the pretty-printer is when generating lemma signatures. Higher verbosity levels produce more explicit output, which can help avoid ambiguity in complex type situations.

- `verbosity=0` (default): Standard pretty-printing options
- `verbosity=1`: Robust options with additional explicitness
- `verbosity=2`: Extra robust options with maximum explicitness

#### When to use higher verbosity

Consider this example involving coercions:
```
theorem explicit_coercion_test (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) : True := by
  have h : (∑ i : Fin n, (1 : ℝ) / (i.val + 1)) ≤ (harmonic n : ℝ) + 1 := by
    sorry
  trivial
```

With default verbosity (`verbosity=0`), the coercion `(harmonic n : ℝ)` may be pretty-printed as `Rat.cast (harmonic n)`, losing the target type `ℝ`. This causes Lean to fail with errors like "failed to synthesize RatCast ℕ" because it can't infer the correct target type for the coercion.

With `verbosity=2`, the pretty-printer uses `pp.explicit=true`, which preserves the target type information and produces a valid lemma signature.

**Rule of thumb:** If you encounter type inference errors in generated lemmas—especially involving coercions, casts, or polymorphic functions—try increasing the verbosity level.

Do note that at `verbosity=2`, type signatures may become incredibly complex and unreadable, so it should be used sparingly.

### Summary

These configuration options provide some flexibility around usage, at the cost of correctness in some cases. Try to keep this in mind when generating bug reports -- some of these errors aren't fixable without significant effort.""",

```python
# Only extract sorries
result = await axle.sorry2lemma(content, environment="lean-4.28.0", extract_errors=False)

# Only extract errors
result = await axle.sorry2lemma(content, environment="lean-4.28.0", extract_sorries=False)

??? "`remove_sections`"
    Removes `section`, `namespace`, and `end` commands. Declaration names are fully qualified to preserve semantics. If a `noncomputable section` is removed, `noncomputable section` is re-inserted at the top of the file to preserve semantics.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    namespace MyNamespace
    noncomputable section MySection

    theorem foo : 1 = 1 := rfl

    end MySection
    end MyNamespace
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    noncomputable section
    theorem MyNamespace.foo : 1 = 1 := rfl
    ```

??? "`expand_decl_names`"
    Fully qualifies declaration names by prepending all enclosing namespaces. Useful for making declarations unambiguous without relying on namespace context.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    open Option
    example (α : Type) (x : α) :
        Option.getD (some x) x = x := by
      simp [getD]
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    open Option
    example (α : Type) (x : α) :
        Option.getD (Option.some x) x = x := by
      simp [Option.getD]
    ```

??? "`expand_scoped_notations`"
    Expands scoped notations (those brought in by `open`) into their underlying applications. This runs Lean's delaborator with notations disabled, so the expanded form uses function application. Combined with `expand_decl_names`, constant names in the output are fully qualified.

    Note: inside an expanded notation, all nested notations are stripped — including globals like +. This expander can be over-aggressive for notations whose body contains other, non-scoped notations.

    Note: the delaborator isn't guaranteed to round-trip cleanly — coercions, universe annotations, and a few other constructs are known trouble spots and may produce output that doesn't re-elaborate. Uncommon in practice, but keep `failsafe` on if correctness matters.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    namespace MyNS
    scoped infix:65 " ⊹ " => HAdd.hAdd
    end MyNS

    open MyNS

    def x : Nat := (1 ⊹ 2) + 3
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    namespace MyNS
    scoped infix:65 " ⊹ " => HAdd.hAdd
    end MyNS

    open MyNS

    def x : Nat := ( HAdd.hAdd  1  2 ) + 3
    ```

??? "`remove_duplicates`"
    Removes duplicate commands, such as repeated `open` statements for the same module.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    open Nat
    open Nat
    open List
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    open Nat
    open List
    ```

??? "`split_open_in_commands`"
    Splits `open [modules] in [decl]` syntax into separate `open` and declaration commands. This makes the structure more explicit and easier to process.

    **Before:**
    ```lean
    open Nat in
    theorem foo : succ 0 = 1 := rfl
    ```

    **After:**
    ```lean
    open Nat
    theorem foo : succ 0 = 1 := rfl
    ```

??? "`normalize_module_comments`"
    Converts module documentation comments (`/-! ... -/`) into regular block comments (`/- ... -/`). Module comments are typically used for file-level documentation.

??? "`normalize_doc_comments`"
    Converts documentation comments (`/-- ... -/`) into regular block comments (`/- ... -/`). Doc comments are typically attached to declarations to provide API documentation.""",
