# extract_theorems

!!! warning "Deprecated"
    `extract_theorems` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use [`extract_decls`](extract_decls.md) instead, which supports all declaration kinds (def, theorem, lemma, abbrev, instance, structure, etc.).

Split a file containing one or more theorems into smaller units, each containing a single theorem along with any required dependencies.

## Input Parameters

??? "`content` · str · required · Lean source code"
    The Lean source code to be processed by this tool.

??? "`ignore_imports` · bool · default: `True` · Ignore import mismatches"
    Controls import statement handling:

    - `true` (default): Ignore the imports in `content` and substitute the environment's default header. This uses the pre-built cached environment, so it is fast. The substituted code is returned in the `content` field.
    - `false`: Process the imports in `content` exactly as written. This is significantly slower (the cached environment cannot be reused) and may produce inconsistent or incorrect results if a required dependency such as `Mathlib.Tactic` is missing. A warning is returned in these cases. See the troubleshooting page for more details.

??? "`environment` · str · required · Lean environment or version"
    The Lean environment to use for evaluation. Each environment includes a specific
    Lean version and pre-built dependencies (typically Mathlib).

    Available environments: `lean-4.28.0`, `lean-4.27.0`, `lean-4.26.0`, etc.

??? "`timeout_seconds` · float · default: `120` · Max execution time in seconds"
    Maximum execution time in seconds. Requests exceeding this limit return a timeout error. Note that end-to-end request latency may exceed this timeout due to queue time and other overhead. Additionally, all non-admin requests are subject to an absolute maximum timeout of 900 seconds (15 minutes).


## Output Fields

??? "`content` · string · Processed Lean code"
    The Lean code that was actually processed. May differ from input if `ignore_imports=true` caused header injection.

??? "`lean_messages` · dict · Messages from Lean compiler"
    Messages from the Lean compiler with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.
    Errors here indicate invalid Lean code (syntax errors, type errors, etc.); an empty `errors` list means the code compiles.

??? "`tool_messages` · dict · Messages from extraction tool"
    Messages from the extraction tool with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.
    Errors here indicate tool-specific issues (not Lean compilation errors).

??? "`documents` · dict · Theorem names mapped to self-contained documents"
    Dictionary mapping theorem names to self-contained Lean code documents. Each key is a theorem name, and the value is a self-contained breakdown of the theorem, including a content field containing that theorem plus all dependencies it needs (imports, definitions, etc.).

??? "`timings` · dict · Execution timing breakdown"
    Timing information in milliseconds for various stages of processing.


## Document Fields

Each document in the `documents` dictionary contains:

??? "`kind` · str · The kind of declaration"
    The kind of the declaration. For `extract_theorems`, this is always `"theorem"`. For `extract_decls`, possible values are: `theorem`, `def`, `abbrev`, `axiom`, `opaque`, `structure`, `class`, `class inductive`, `inductive`, `instance`, `example`, `unknown`.

??? "`declaration` · str · The declaration source code"
    The raw source code of this declaration.

??? "`content` · str · Standalone content including declaration and dependencies"
    Complete, self-contained Lean code that includes the declaration and all its local dependencies. Can be compiled independently.

??? "`tokens` · list[str] · Raw tokens from the declaration"
    The declaration's source code split into tokens.

??? "`signature` · str · Declaration signature (everything before the body)"
    The declaration signature, e.g., `theorem foo (x : Nat) : x = x` or `def bar : Nat`.

??? "`type` · str · Pretty-printed type of the declaration"
    The type of the declaration as pretty-printed by Lean.

??? "`type_hash` · int · Hash of the canonical type expression"
    Hash of the canonical, alpha-invariant type expression. Useful for deduplication.

??? "`type_depth` · int · Structural depth of the type expression"
    The nesting depth of the declaration's type as a Lean expression. This field maxes out at 255.

??? "`term_depth` · int · Structural depth of the value expression"
    The nesting depth of the declaration's value or proof as a Lean expression, or 0 when the declaration has no value. This field maxes out at 255.

??? "`is_sorry` · bool · Whether the declaration contains a sorry"
    True if the declaration contains a `sorry`.

??? "`index` · int · 0-based index in original file"
    Position of this declaration in the original file. Note: indices may not be contiguous (mutual definitions share indices).

??? "`line_pos` · int · 1-based line number where declaration starts"
    Line number where the declaration begins.

??? "`end_line_pos` · int · 1-based line number where declaration ends"
    Line number where the declaration ends.

??? "`proof_length` · int · Approximate number of tactics in proof"
    Rough measure of proof complexity based on tactic count. Only meaningful for theorems/lemmas with tactic proofs.

??? "`tactic_counts` · dict[str, int] · Map of tactic names to occurrence counts"
    Breakdown of which tactics are used and how often. Only meaningful for theorems/lemmas with tactic proofs.

??? "`wall_ms` · int · Wall-clock milliseconds to elaborate the command"
    How long this command took to elaborate. This field reports wall-clock time, so it can vary from run to run.

??? "`heartbeats` · int · Heartbeats consumed elaborating the command"
    Lean heartbeats consumed while elaborating this command.

??? "`local_type_dependencies` · list[str] · Local dependencies of the type"
    Local declarations that the declaration's type depends on (non-transitive).

??? "`local_value_dependencies` · list[str] · Local dependencies of the body"
    Local declarations that the declaration's body/proof depends on (non-transitive).

??? "`external_type_dependencies` · list[str] · Immediate external dependencies of the type"
    External constants (builtins, imports) that appear in the type.

??? "`external_value_dependencies` · list[str] · Immediate external dependencies of the body"
    External constants (builtins, imports) that appear in the body/proof.

??? "`local_syntactic_dependencies` · list[str] · Local constants explicitly written in source"
    Local constants that appear literally in source (not from notation/macro expansion).

??? "`external_syntactic_dependencies` · list[str] · External constants explicitly written in source"
    External constants that appear literally in source (not from notation/macro expansion).

??? "`declaration_messages` · dict · Messages specific to this declaration"
    Lean messages (`errors`, `warnings`, `infos`) specific to this declaration in the original document.

??? "`theorem_messages` · dict · (Deprecated) Messages specific to this declaration"
    Lean messages (`errors`, `warnings`, `infos`) specific to this declaration. For `extract_theorems`, this contains the same data as `declaration_messages`. For `extract_decls`, this is always empty.

    !!! warning "Deprecated"
        This field is deprecated. Use `declaration_messages` instead for new code.
