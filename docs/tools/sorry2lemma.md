This tool is partially powered by [`extract_goal`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Tactic/ExtractGoal.html), a Mathlib tactic for extracting goals into standalone declarations.

## Input Parameters

??? "`content` · str · required · Lean source code"
    The Lean source code to be processed by this tool.

??? "`names` · list[str] · Theorem names to process"
    Optional list of theorem names to process. If not specified, all theorems are processed.
    Names not found in the code are silently ignored.
    When `theorems_only` is `false`, these select over all declarations (not just theorems).

??? "`indices` · list[str] · Theorem indices to process"
    Optional list of theorem indices to process (0-based). Supports negative indices:
    `-1` is the last theorem, `-2` is second-to-last, etc.
    If not specified, all theorems are processed.
    When `theorems_only` is `false`, these select over all declarations (not just theorems).

??? "`extract_sorries` · bool · default: `True` · Lift sorries into standalone lemmas"
    If `true`, `sorry` placeholders are extracted into standalone lemmas. Defaults to true.

??? "`extract_errors` · bool · default: `True` · Lift errors into standalone lemmas"
    If `true`, error positions (type mismatches, etc.) are extracted into standalone lemmas. Defaults to true.

??? "`include_whole_context` · bool · default: `True` · Include whole context when extracting"
    If `true`, lemmas include all context variables. If `false`, attempts to minimize the context. Defaults to true.

??? "`reconstruct_callsite` · bool · default: `False` · Replace sorry with lemma call"
    If `true`, the original `sorry` is replaced with a call to the extracted lemma. Defaults to false.

??? "`merge_duplicates` · bool · default: `False` · Merge duplicate extracted lemmas (by definitional equality)"
    If `true`, extracted lemmas within the same parent that are definitionally equal — to each other, or to the `theorem`/`lemma` they were extracted from — are merged: duplicates collapse into a single lemma that all callsites reference, and a sorry whose goal is definitionally equal to its parent theorem/lemma is dropped rather than lifted into a restatement (e.g. a top-level `:= sorry` / `:= by sorry`). The parent-restatement check applies only to `theorem`/`lemma` parents, not `def`/`instance`/etc. Defaults to false.

??? "`theorems_only` · bool · default: `True` · Process theorems/lemmas only"
    If `true` (default), only `theorem`/`lemma` declarations are processed. Set to `false` to process all declaration kinds (`def`/`instance`/`abbrev`/`opaque`/etc). When `false`, `names` and `indices` select over all declarations rather than just theorems.

??? "`verbosity` · float · default: `0` · Pretty-printer verbosity level (0-2)"
    0=default, 1=robust, 2=extra robust. Higher levels produce more explicit type annotations. Use when default output has ambiguity errors.

??? "`ignore_imports` · bool · default: `True` · Ignore import mismatches"
    Controls import statement handling:

    - `true` (default): Ignore the imports in `content` and substitute the environment's default header. This uses the pre-built cached environment, so it is fast. The substituted code is returned in the `content` field.
    - `false`: Process the imports in `content` exactly as written. This is significantly slower (the cached environment cannot be reused) and may produce inconsistent or incorrect results if a required dependency such as `Mathlib.Tactic` is missing. A warning is returned in these cases. See the troubleshooting page for more details.

??? "`environment` · str · required · Lean environment or version"
    The Lean environment to use for evaluation. Each environment includes a specific
    Lean version and pre-built dependencies (typically Mathlib).

    Available environments: `lean-4.28.0`, `lean-4.27.0`, `lean-4.26.0`, etc.

??? "`timeout_seconds` · float · default: `120` · Max execution time in seconds"
    Maximum execution time in seconds. Requests exceeding this limit return a timeout error. Note that end-to-end request latency may exceed this timeout due to queue time and other overhead. Additionally, all non-admin requests are subject to an absolute maximum timeout of 900 seconds (15 minutes).


## Output Fields

??? "`lean_messages` · dict · Messages from Lean compiler"
    Messages from the Lean compiler with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.
    Errors here indicate invalid Lean code (syntax errors, type errors, etc.); an empty `errors` list means the code compiles.

??? "`tool_messages` · dict · Messages from sorry2lemma tool"
    Messages from the sorry2lemma tool with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.
    Errors here indicate tool-specific issues (not Lean compilation errors).

??? "`content` · string · Lean code with sorries/errors extracted as lemmas"
    The code with `sorry` and error positions lifted to top-level lemmas with their goals as types.

??? "`lemma_names` · list · Names of newly created lemmas"
    Names are auto-generated based on the parent theorem and position.

??? "`timings` · dict · Execution timing breakdown"
    Timing information in milliseconds for various stages of processing.

## Demo

The `sorry2lemma` tool extracts `sorry` placeholders and unsolved goals at error locations into standalone lemmas. This is useful for breaking down incomplete proofs into subgoals that can be tackled independently.

### `extract_sorries` and `extract_errors`

You can control which types of goals are extracted:

```python
# Only extract sorries
result = await axle.sorry2lemma(content, environment="lean-4.28.0", extract_errors=False)

# Only extract errors
result = await axle.sorry2lemma(content, environment="lean-4.28.0", extract_sorries=False)

# Extract neither (effectively a no-op)
result = await axle.sorry2lemma(content, environment="lean-4.28.0", extract_sorries=False, extract_errors=False)
```

### `include_whole_context`, `reconstruct_callsite`, `verbosity`
Refer to the [have2lemma documentation](have2lemma.md#demo) for a detailed description and examples of these fields. `sorry2lemma` handles them in mostly the same way.

**Multiple goals:** When a single sorry applies to multiple goals (e.g., after `<;>`), the tool generates multiple lemmas and combines them with `first`:
```lean
-- Input
theorem multiple (n : Nat) : 1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2 := by constructor <;> sorry

-- Output with reconstruct_callsite=true
theorem multiple (n : Nat) : 1 = 1 ∧ 2 = 2 := by constructor <;> (first | exact multiple.sorried n | exact multiple.sorried_1 n)
```
