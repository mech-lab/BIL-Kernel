# check

Evaluate Lean code and collect all messages (errors, warnings, and info). Use this to check if code compiles without verification against a formal statement, or to get the output of `#check` / `#eval` statements.

> **Looking to confirm a proof?** `check` reports compilation only — its `okay` field stays `true` even when a declaration uses `sorry` or a disallowed axiom. If you want a single pass/fail for "is this a complete, valid proof of a given statement," use [`verify_proof`](verify_proof.md) instead, which folds those failures into `okay`.

## Input Parameters

??? "`content` · str · required · Lean source code"
    The Lean source code to be processed by this tool.

??? "`mathlib_options` · bool · default: `False` · Enable Mathlib options"
    If true, enables conventional Mathlib options. This toggle sets `linter.mathlibStandardSet` to true, `autoImplicit` to false, `relaxedAutoImplicit` to false, and `pp.unicode.fun` to true.

??? "`ignore_imports` · bool · default: `True` · Ignore import mismatches"
    Controls import statement handling:

    - `true` (default): Ignore the imports in `content` and substitute the environment's default header. This uses the pre-built cached environment, so it is fast. The substituted code is returned in the `content` field.
    - `false`: Process the imports in `content` exactly as written. This is significantly slower (the cached environment cannot be reused) and may produce inconsistent or incorrect results if a required dependency such as `Mathlib.Tactic` is missing. A warning is returned in these cases. See the troubleshooting page for more details.

??? "`environment` · str · required · Lean environment or version"
    The Lean environment to use for evaluation. Each environment includes a specific
    Lean version and pre-built dependencies (typically Mathlib).

    Available environments: `lean-4.28.0`, `lean-4.27.0`, `lean-4.26.0`, etc.

??? "`timeout_seconds` · float · default: `120` · Max execution time in seconds"
    Maximum execution time in seconds. Requests exceeding this limit return a timeout error. Note that end-to-end request latency may exceed this timeout due to queue time and other overhead. Additionally, all non-admin requests are subject to an absolute maximum timeout of 900 seconds (15 minutes).


## Output Fields

??? "`okay` · bool · True if the Lean code compiles"
    Returns `true` if the code compiles without errors. Warnings don't affect this value.

    This only reflects compilation. It does **not** mean the code is a complete, valid proof: a declaration that uses `sorry`, disallowed axioms, or unsafe definitions still compiles and leaves `okay` as `true`. Those findings are reported in `tool_messages.warnings` (with the offending names in `failed_declarations`). If you need to know whether the input is a real proof, also check that `failed_declarations` is empty, or better yet, use [`verify_proof`](verify_proof.md).

??? "`content` · string · Processed Lean code"
    The Lean code that was actually processed. May differ from input if `ignore_imports=true` caused header injection.

??? "`lean_messages` · dict · Messages from Lean compiler"
    Messages from the Lean compiler with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.
    Errors here indicate invalid Lean code (syntax errors, type errors, etc.); an empty `errors` list means the code compiles.

??? "`tool_messages` · dict · Messages from check tool"
    Messages from the check tool with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.

    Validation findings — uses of `sorry`, disallowed axioms, or unsafe definitions — are reported as warnings here. Use [`verify_proof`](verify_proof.md) to treat them as errors.

??? "`failed_declarations` · list · Declaration names that failed validation"
    List of declaration names that have compilation or validation errors. These are declarations that do not compile, use `sorry`, use disallowed axioms, etc. A file-level validation finding (e.g. use of `open private`) marks every declaration in the file as failed.

??? "`timings` · dict · Execution timing breakdown"
    Timing information in milliseconds for various stages of processing.


## Python API

```python
result = await axle.check(
    content="import Mathlib\n#eval 2+2",
    environment="lean-4.28.0",
    mathlib_options=False,     # Optional
    ignore_imports=True,     # Optional
    timeout_seconds=120,      # Optional
)

print(result.okay)  # True if code compiles
print(result.okay and not result.failed_declarations)  # True if code compiles AND contains only complete, valid proofs
print(result.content)  # The processed Lean code
print(result.lean_messages.infos)  # ["4\n"]
```

## CLI

**Usage:** `axle check CONTENT [OPTIONS]`

```bash
# Basic usage
axle check theorem.lean --environment lean-4.28.0
# Pipeline usage
cat theorem.lean | axle check - --environment lean-4.28.0
# Exit non-zero if code is invalid
axle check theorem.lean --strict --environment lean-4.28.0
# Use in shell conditionals
if axle check theorem.lean --strict --environment lean-4.28.0 > /dev/null; then
    echo "Valid Lean code"
fi
```
