## Input Parameters

??? "`content` · str · required · Lean source code"
    The Lean source code to be processed by this tool.

??? "`names` · list[str] · Theorem names to process"
    Optional list of theorem names to process. If not specified, all theorems are processed.
    Names not found in the code are silently ignored.
    When `theorems_only` is `false`, these select over all declarations (not just theorems).

??? "`indices` · list[str] · Theorem indices to process"
    Optional list of theorem indices to process (0-based). Supports negative indices:
    `-1` is the last theorem, `-2` is second-to-last, etc.
    If not specified, all theorems are processed.
    When `theorems_only` is `false`, these select over all declarations (not just theorems).

??? "`terminal_tactics` · list[str] · default: `['grind']` · Tactics to try when attempting to disprove"
    Tactics tried in order to prove the negation. `grind` often works for false statements. Defaults to 'grind'.

??? "`theorems_only` · bool · default: `True` · Process theorems/lemmas only"
    If `true` (default), only `theorem`/`lemma` declarations are processed. Set to `false` to process all declaration kinds (`def`/`instance`/`abbrev`/`opaque`/etc). When `false`, `names` and `indices` select over all declarations rather than just theorems.

    Note: on this tool, operations on non-theorem kinds are a no-op.

??? "`ignore_imports` · bool · default: `True` · Ignore import mismatches"
    Controls import statement handling:

    - `true` (default): Ignore the imports in `content` and substitute the environment's default header. This uses the pre-built cached environment, so it is fast. The substituted code is returned in the `content` field.
    - `false`: Process the imports in `content` exactly as written. This is significantly slower (the cached environment cannot be reused) and may produce inconsistent or incorrect results if a required dependency such as `Mathlib.Tactic` is missing. A warning is returned in these cases. See the troubleshooting page for more details.

??? "`environment` · str · required · Lean environment or version"
    The Lean environment to use for evaluation. Each environment includes a specific
    Lean version and pre-built dependencies (typically Mathlib).

    Available environments: `lean-4.28.0`, `lean-4.27.0`, `lean-4.26.0`, etc.

??? "`timeout_seconds` · float · default: `120` · Max execution time in seconds"
    Maximum execution time in seconds. Requests exceeding this limit return a timeout error. Note that end-to-end request latency may exceed this timeout due to queue time and other overhead. Additionally, all non-admin requests are subject to an absolute maximum timeout of 900 seconds (15 minutes).


## Output Fields

??? "`content` · string · Processed Lean code"
    The Lean code that was actually processed. May differ from input if `ignore_imports=true` caused header injection.

??? "`lean_messages` · dict · Messages from Lean compiler"
    Messages from the Lean compiler with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.
    Errors here indicate invalid Lean code (syntax errors, type errors, etc.); an empty `errors` list means the code compiles.

??? "`tool_messages` · dict · Messages from disprove tool"
    Messages from the disprove tool with `errors`, `warnings`, and `infos` lists.
    Errors here indicate tool-specific issues (not Lean compilation errors).

??? "`results` · dict · Map from theorem name to disprove result"
    Each theorem maps to a string indicating the outcome of the disprove attempt.

??? "`negated` · dict · Map from theorem name to negated goal"
    Each theorem maps to the negated goal type that was attempted (the statement whose proof would disprove the theorem).

??? "`disproved_theorems` · list · List of theorems that were disproved"
    List of theorems that were disproved

??? "`timings` · dict · Execution timing breakdown"
    Timing information in milliseconds for various stages of processing.
