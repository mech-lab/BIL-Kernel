# AXLE - Axiom Lean Engine

## Proof manipulation as infrastructure, not an afterthought

AXLE is a set of Lean utilities for theorem proving: validating candidate proofs, splitting theorems from larger files, converting proofs to `sorry`, and more. They are written as Lean metaprograms to be robust.

## Features

- **Proof Verification**: Validate proofs against formal statements
- **Code Analysis**: Check Lean code for errors and extract theorems
- **Code Transformation**: Rename declarations, convert keywords, simplify proofs

## Usage Methods

AXLE can be accessed through:

1. **Web Interface** - Interactive UI at [https://axle.axiommath.ai/](https://axle.axiommath.ai/)
2. **Python API** - `pip install axiom-axle` ([Python API Reference](python-api.md))
3. **CLI** - `axle verify-proof`, `axle check`, etc. ([CLI Reference](cli-reference.md))
4. **HTTP API** - Direct REST calls with `curl`

See the [Quick Start](quickstart.md) tutorial for examples of each method.

## Public Deployments

AXLE's public deployment follows a weekly release schedule:

- **Maintenance Window**: Every Wednesday at 10:00 AM Pacific Time
- **Expected Downtime**: Brief interruption (typically under 5 minutes) during restart
- **Updates**: New features, bug fixes, and improvements deployed weekly

After each deployment, the [changelog](https://github.com/AxiomMath/axiom-lean-engine/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) is updated with details on what changed.
