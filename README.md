<summary><strong>July 1, 2026 - v1.4.0</strong></summary>

This update comes with two notable changes and a variety of additional features:

- **`ignore_imports` now defaults to `true`** — on an import mismatch, AXLE substitutes the default header and reuses the cached environment.
- In turn, **`ignore_imports=false` no longer errors: it now processes your imports as written**. However, note that this is much slower and may cause issues if a dependency is missing. See [Import Mismatches](https://axle.axiommath.ai/v1/docs/troubleshooting/#import-mismatches).
- **Reworked `okay` and `tool_messages`** — `check` now reports `sorry`/axiom/unsafe findings as warnings (not errors), and `repair_proofs` reports failed repairs as errors. See [Interpreting the `okay` field](https://axle.axiommath.ai/v1/docs/troubleshooting/#interpreting-the-okay-field).

Also: opaque support in `merge`/`extract_decls`, a `disprove` fix, and Lean 4.30/4.31. See the [changelog](https://axle.axiommath.ai/v1/docs/changelog/) for more details.

<summary><strong>June 24, 2026 - 📣 AXLE @ ICML 2026</strong></summary>

We're presenting AXLE at the **3rd AI for Math Workshop** at **ICML 2026** in Seoul, as a contributed talk. Come find our poster and say hi! Read the technical report on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26442).

<details>
<summary><strong>June 3, 2026 - v1.3.0</strong></summary>

Support for all declaration kinds, a reworked `repair_proofs`, link shortening, and broader MCP support. See the [changelog](https://axle.axiommath.ai/v1/docs/changelog/) for details and other changes.

### Highlights:
- **All declaration kinds:** A new `theorems_only` option lets most tools select over **every** declaration kind — definitions, opaques, instances, and more — not just theorems and lemmas. Set it to `false` to opt in.
- **Reworked `repair_proofs`:** New passes, stacked repairs, and clearer messages for failed repairs.
- **Tool updates:** Changes and new options for `verify_proof`, `merge`, `extract_decls`, and `sorry2lemma`.
- **Link shortening:** Short, shareable links to requests.
- **MCP web support:** The [`axiom-axle-mcp`](https://pypi.org/project/axiom-axle-mcp/) server now works with Claude web, desktop, and mobile.

<summary><strong>April 15, 2026 - v1.2.0</strong></summary>

New `extract_decls` tool for extracting all declaration kinds, and corresponding updates to `extract_theorems`. Users using `extract_theorems` (which will be deprecated in a future update) should migrate to `extract_decls`. See the [changelog](https://axle.axiommath.ai/v1/docs/changelog/) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>April 8, 2026 - v1.1.1</strong></summary>

Default option changes, a Lean version bump, and bug fixes.

### Highlights:
- **Default options changed:** `autoImplicit` is now set to `true` by default, matching standard Lean behavior.
- **Lean 4.29.0:** Added the latest stable Lean release.
- **Timeout bug fix:** Fixed a bug where requests were prematurely preempted. Requests now properly max out at the 15-minute maximum timeout.

See the [changelog](https://axle.axiommath.ai/v1/docs/changelog/) for details and other changes.

<summary><strong>April 1, 2026 - v1.1.0</strong></summary>

🎉 After mass feedback from the public, we're excited to announce that AXLE is switching from Lean to Rocq. The new name will be **AXRE** (Axiom Rocq Engine). All existing Lean proofs will be automatically translated using GPT-2. 🚀

### Notable API changes:
- `document_messages` has been removed from `extract_theorems`. To replicate old behavior, run the `content` field of the resulting documents through the `check` tool.
- Lean messages now include end positions across all tools, changing the format from `-:4:38: ...` to `-:4:38-4:43: ...`.

### Performance improvements:
- Reworked the Lean worker pool for faster responses, no environment warm-up time, and more secure containers.
- Improved the worker scaling pipeline to decrease delays when all worker slots are busy or offline. In the worst case, users should expect no more than a 2-3 minute delay before more worker capacity spins up.

<summary><strong>March 11, 2026 - v1.0.1</strong></summary>

New documentation pages, increased rate limits, and bug fixes. See the [changelog](https://axle.axiommath.ai/v1/docs/changelog/) for details.

### Lean Zulip Thread

Join the discussion, ask questions, and share feedback on the [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/113486-announce/topic/Axiom.20Lean.20Engine/with/577609358).

### Higher Rate Limits
Rate limits were unintentionally too restrictive:

- API key users: increased to 20 active requests (up from 4)
- Anonymous users: increased to 10 active requests (up from 1)
- Max timeout: increased to 15 minutes (up from 5 minutes)

**Users with an API key should regenerate their key to apply the new limits.**

### AXLE Public Release
We're excited to release AXLE to the public! AXLE provides proof verification and manipulation primitives we've used across all of our research efforts, including training AI models and AxiomProver's 12/12 on Putnam 2025.
